Implementation Plan for goal suggestion system using Machine Learning:

	1.	Phase 1: Interaction Logging and Feedback Collection:
	•	Implement logging for user interactions with goals.
	•	Collect and store user feedback.
	2.	Phase 2: Retraining Based on Interaction Data:
	•	Develop a process for periodic model retraining using interaction data.
	•	Automate the retraining and deployment process.
	3.	Phase 3: Advanced Filtering and Context Awareness:
	•	Implement collaborative filtering using LightFM or similar techniques.
	•	Integrate contextual data for dynamic goal suggestions.
	4.	Phase 4: Continuous Improvement and Personalization:
	•	Continuously monitor the performance of the ML model.
	•	Fine-tune models for individual users based on accumulated data.
	5.	Phase 5: Exploration of Advanced Techniques:
	•	Explore the use of transfer learning and data augmentation to further enhance model performance.
